# My first blog
I finished my study in Front End Web Development in IT cast Education and Baidu Institute of Front End Technology. I have built an small social media website with NodeJS, Bootstrap and Mongo DB on which users can register, login, upload and edit their photos, post their blog and make comments. Another project I have finished is a single-page web app which can dynamically deliver the content of Douban blog. Now I'm experienced in MVC and MVVM developing and proficient in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Nodejs, Git and gulp. Currently I'm doing an academic searching and recommendation website for college students who are choosing research teams for their graduate study.
